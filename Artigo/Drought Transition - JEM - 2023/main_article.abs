In the Anthropocene, human activities began to exert a great influence on the planet's natural cycles. In relation to droughts, anthropic activities have become an increasingly representative component in the processes of generation and development of this phenomenon. In this context, methodologies capable of identifying signs of anthropic impacts on the aforementioned processes become of utmost importance for efficient drought management. In the present study, it was sought to evaluate the changes in the transition patterns between meteorological and hydrological drought classes and in the probability of occurrence of these drought classes for a sub-basin of the SÃ£o Francisco River Hydrographic Basin (BHSF), more precisely in western Bahia, for two reference periods: P1, from 1935 to 1984, and P2, from 1985 to 2020. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standard Runoff Index (SRI) drought indices were adopted to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts, respectively. The transition analysis between drought classes and their occurrence probabilities was performed using Markov Chains, considering the SPI and SRI series in periods P1 and P2. The results pointed to a higher probability of occurrence of hydrological and meteorological droughts classified as Severe or Extreme in the P2 period, with a higher probability of persistence of this state in hydrological droughts. The meteorological droughts, in its turn, showed no possibility of persistence of this state, suggesting that the persistence observed in hydrological droughts may be associated with mechanisms other than precipitation.
