\section{Discussions}

    The analysis of drought state transitions showed significant changes in hydrological drought state transitions between the P1 and P2 periods that were not observed for meteorological droughts. 
    
    Hydrological droughts, given the occurrence of more severe drought states (MD or SED), presented a higher probability of intensification or permanence of these drought states in the P2 period.
